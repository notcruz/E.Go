## E.Go

We, E. Go, seek to develop a social media network that focuses on tracking and persuading users to perform positive actions that will better help our environment. We accomplish this goal by rewarding users with points for positive actions, notifying users of events in which they can help the environment and informing them about the impact they had on the environment by deciding to perform a positive action. E.Go will motivate users by implementing a competitive and point system, in which users can compete against each other based on their performance. 

The E.Go application helps the environment through a fun and competitive way. The point base system will allow users to want to do more for the game, which will also help the environment. Another way E.Go will motivate users to care more about the environment is by providing information about the impact positive actions have on our environment, on a global scale. We envision this to primarily focus on trash pickups and waste disposal, but will soon focus on reducing car emissions.

The problem here is most people around the world are unaware about the negative impact they’re making on the environment. This app, while also spreading awareness, takes action on climate change by encouraging the user to pick up trash and to be rewarded for doing so. Automobiles create 33% of all U.S. air influence in toxic chemicals which in turn heats up the planet while also destroying the ecosystem. Eating the wrong types of food or too much of it leads to a massive depletion of our natural resources and can cause greenhouse gas emissions.
